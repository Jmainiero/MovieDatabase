TeamTreeHouse is an online learning school that is designed to help beginner programmers because well-versed in modern languages.


Throughout my personal studies I encountered a free course that utilized an API called OMDB (The Open Movie Database). Although I never took this specific course I enjoyed the idea of using this API to make something similar to a much more well known database -- IMDB.


The goal of this project was to find an elegant way to display as much information about a movie title as possible.


This was done using Javascript, HTML and CSS5.
